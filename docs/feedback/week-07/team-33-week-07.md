# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Stephan Popov

Minute taker: Jan De Munck

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda covers the main points, even though sections like the demonstration of the state of the application and some feedback on the HCI report could have been added. Additionally, the agenda points should be more specific, e.g. instead of saying "Questions to the TA that can be Code Related, Assignment Related, or any other issue", mention specific questions you might have. However, I appreciate you including the agenda for your individual team meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes cover both the meeting with me and the first half of the meeting that you had without me extensively. All the important agreements were written down, and adding the meeting overview at the end makes it easy to keep track of the main points discussed. Good job!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: You kept the meeting moving whenever there was a break in the discussion, and you ensured that the agenda was covered. In the future, you can encourage the others to contribute in the meeting more when there is a silence that comes up. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: There were silences throuhgout, and some slumps in the discussion, but everyone is always interested in the topics being discussed. This also leads to everyone contributing. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The front-end components and some server components seem to work nicely so far. I think that if you manage to tie everything together, you should be on track to finish the basic features, and hopefully some further functionality as well. Just truly focus on setting up the connection with the server properly, and then you will hopefully be able to implement further features.
