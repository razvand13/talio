# Get to know each other

#### 1) Self-organization

Was the team in charge? Did everybody speak? Was the tone respectful?

Sufficient

The contributions throughout the team were evenly split and the tone was respectful. At the beginning the team was very quiet, but throughout the meeting the group got more engaged and everybody spoke up and contributed equally.


#### 2) Suggested Topics

Have all the suggested topics been covered? Did they try to moderate the meeting?

Sufficient

At the beginning the meeting was a bit quiet and slow and I took a greater role. However, then the meeting moved over to the team asking me questions independently and then the team taking over control and discussing the code of conduct and the project expectations by themselves. At the end, the team had covered the suggested topics independently and managed to carry the discussion by themselves.
