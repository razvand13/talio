# Week 2


## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Stephanie Gilbert
- **Notetaker**: Stephan Popov


#### Meeting Organization

Were there a chair and a minute taker? 

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Was it delivered in time? Did it follow the template?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was delivered on time and clearly outlined the different talking points as seen in the template. In the future, I would add a field where you fill in the chair and minute taker for the meeting. Also, the agenda covered a time span of 1.5 hours rather than 45 minutes.

#### Chair performance

Did the chair ensure that all topics of the agenda were covered?

Mark: Good

Feedback: I thought it was a nice idea that the agenda came with more extensive chair notes that went more into depth about what will be covered in the meeting. It was also nice that Stephanie summarised the main points and decision throughout the meeting. In the future, I would be a bit more strict on time moderation, because the code of conduct took up a very large part of the discussion.

#### Time management

 Was there time for all topics? Were all topics covered for an appropriate amount of time?

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The code of conduct was discussed more than the other topics, which meant that there was no time left for outlining the plan of action. Since the timing on the agenda was wrong, it also became more difficult to manage the time.

#### Minute taker performance

Is there a good amount of notes? Do the notes contain the team agreements and the assigned people?

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The notes are very brief and glares over finer details, e.g. by saying "define terminology" rather than actually stating the terminology and definitions that were discussed.

#### Relation

Was everyone involved? Did everyone contribute to the discussion topics in an equal amount? Was everyone listened to? Were everybody's ideas taken into account?

Mark: Good

Feedback: Throughout the meeting there was an equal amount of contributions from everyone. The atmosphere when decisions were made was also nice, with every member contributing ideas and arguments for various decisions. The meeting also ended with a reflection on how the meeting had gone and how the chair performed, which was nice.
