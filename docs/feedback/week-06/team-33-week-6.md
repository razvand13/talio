# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Petra Gulyas
Minute taker: Razvan Dinu

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and minute taker. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was provided on time and covered the important discussion points for the week. I also like that the agenda includes both the meeting you had without me and then the meeting with me, since this allows me to see what you have already discussed before. However, I would like you to add a section for the project demonstration next week. Additionally, you can add a section to have a look at the Gitinspector from now on if you want to. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker (Andrei)

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes covered all the important decisions and the answers to the questions asked in the last meeting. I liked the format - writing out the questions and then the answers makes the notes very easy to follow. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: You definitely took charge of the meeting and led the discussion. It was great to see that you ensured that everything was discussed and that all questions anyone had were answered. However, it ended up being mainly you and Stephanie speaking throughout the meeting, so encourage others to speak up more.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: There was a constructive attitude today that translated nicely into how well you were able to discuss the further planning of the distribution of work. It also seems like everyone feels comfortable to ask questions if they don't understand something. However, today's meeting was dominated by Stephanie and Petra, so I encourage everyone else to speak up more. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Since the backend is not completely set up yet, the project is unfortunately not shippable. However, it seems like you are very aware of what needs to be done next, and I look forward to seeing the state of your project next week.
