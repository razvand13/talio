# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Jan de Munck

Minute taker: Andrei Chiru

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker and you both came prepared. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was submitted to the Git repository on time and provides a clear overview of what will be discussed in the meeting. I also appreciated that the exact questions you wanted to ask in the meeting were included in the agenda. More sections like a summary section and (in the future) a section for application demos could be added. Also, try to make the naming of your agenda files more consistent in your repository.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Good job on the notes, they are very extensive and truly cover everything that was discussed. It is also really nice to see that you take and upload notes for your individual team meetings as well!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Jan clearly lead the meeting and ensured that all topics in the agenda were covered. The section with the task distribution and project planning was less strictly regulated and more free flowing, but this was okay since this part is supposed to be more like a brainstorming session. At the end the time was mismanaged a bit and the meeting went slightly overtime, but Jan noticed early enough to bring the meeting to an appropriate conclusion. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The overall atmosphere in the group is positive and constructive - everyone is interested in the conversation and makes intelligent contributions. I also like the critical discussions that happened throughout the meeting, for example by discussing various user stories and asking technical questions about unclarities. However, there are still some slumps in the conversation sometimes: for these situations, everyone can try to speak up more, or the chair can suggest moving on to another topic. 

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There is no current application yet, but I can see that you are enthusiastic about starting to code and will surely do so this week. You have made concrete plans in the meeting today, so if you follow through with these then I hope that you will be on track. Remember to show me the state of your application at our next meeting.
